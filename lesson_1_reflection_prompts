How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped identify the right and wrong use of code when setting the website

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy identification of mistakes between previous documents and 
    avoidance of going through entire file of code ti identify mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual changes allow for logical changes to occure between commits (gits way of version 
    control). Unlike in google docs where autosave may save versioning where there's no logical change
    between commits or there's far too track between document versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To account for documents that have dependancies on one another and make it 
    easier to track changes between files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to draw up commits to describe the logical changes in versioning and use git 
    diff to easily track the changes between commits highlighted with the colour command used git and use global within 
    that to apply it across all repositorie

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control will make it easy to track down bugs introduced by easily checking out previous versions 
    without the worry of losing the most current version work additions. Removing this worry will therefore increase confidence

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want ot use git for setting up file repos for ADP and being able to monitor version control between 
    files I'm creating for the ADP model in case any bugs are introduced into th software
